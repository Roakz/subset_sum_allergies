<h1>Creating a Subset Sum solution</h1>

<h3>The problem</h3>

 An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:<br><br>

eggs (1)<br>
peanuts (2)<br>
shellfish (4)<br>
strawberries (8)<br>
tomatoes (16)<br>
chocolate (32)<br>
pollen (64)<br>
cats (128)<br><br>

so if a person was allergic to everything there score would be 255 <br>
If they were allergic to eggs, peanuts and cats their score would be 131<br><br>

<h4>Desired outcome</h4>

**-** List the combination of allergies based on a total score given.<br><br>

**Lets do this!!**

**This problem is solved!**<br><Br>

Any feeback or advice welcome!
